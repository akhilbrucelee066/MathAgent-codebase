I have alredy created a simple yet effective agent in "D:\MY CODE\Projects\math\agent_math" but need to improve it to match defined functionalities in the "assignment" so i need to improve it with the help of you.


## the "assignment" is:

Human in a loop: Feedback based learning - Math Routing Agent 

Your goal is to design an Agentic-RAG architecture system that replicates a mathematical 
professor. When presented with a mathematical question, the system should understand and 
generate a step-by-step solution, simplifying it for the student. The response must first check the 
existing knowledge base for relevant information. If the solution is not found in the knowledge 
base, the system should perform a web search and then generate the step-by-step solution. 

The Math-agent must have a solid routing pipeline: 
● AI Gateway mainly guardrails  
○ Integrate the routing agent with AI gateway by adding the Input and Output 
guardrails. Do proper research on how the guardrails is incorporated.  
○ The app should be focused on only delivering education based content mainly: 
Mathematics.

● Knowledge Base Creation 
○ To build an Agentic RAG, the system must adapt to a knowledge base to retrieve 
relevant questions effectively.  
○ You can choose any dataset or math module as the knowledge base and store it 
in a VectorDB.  
○ If the user’s question exists in the knowledge base, the system should retrieve it 
and generate a step-by-step solution to provide simplified results. 
● Web Search or Using MCP  
○ If the user’s question is not found in the knowledge base, the system should 
perform a web search to fetch the result and generate a response.  
○ However, if the question is not available online, the system must ensure it does 
not provide incorrect results.  
○ Furthermore, for this step, you need to have a pipeline for Web Search 
extraction.  
○ Usage of Model Context Protocol (MCP) is MUST.  
● Human-in-the loop mechanism 
○ Incorporate an evaluation or feedback agent layer to enhance the agent's 
performance through self-learning capabilities.  
○ Note: You need to take human feedback and refine the response accordingly.  
○ The final response is subjective and requires a Human-in-the-Loop mechanism for 



Assignment Evaluation Criteria: 
● Your agent will be evaluated based on the following parameters: 
○ If the system is able to route efficiently between knowledge base and search.  
○ Functionality of guardrails and feedback mechanism capabilities.  
○ Feasibility and practicality of implementing the proposed solutions. 
○ Quality and clarity of the final proposal, including actionable insights. 


Suggested Tools & Frameworks 
● Agent Frameworks: use simple yet effective
● Search & Retrieval: 
○ Leverage Serper for advanced web search 
○ Check Awesome MCP server for the relevant MCP server for Search.  



## what i have to complete the project:

- GROQ_API_KEY
- SERPER_API_KEY

i also have an extra API key: GEMINI_API_KEY


## what i have to do (as of my knowledge, i may be wrong, so please correct me if i am, do what is right for the project):

- create a simple yet effective agent framework
- create a guardrails
- create a routing pipeline
- create a knowledge base Functionality
- create a search & retrieval Functionality pipeline 
- create a feedback mechanism(like after checking the answer in knowledge base, if not found it should ask user’s permission "can i search it from web sources" and with human response it should route to web_search Functionality)(in UI, with agent response there will be small "thums up" & "thumbs down" icons in the bottom of the generation to take user stisfaction with agent_answer, to improve future agent answers) - human in the loop mechanism

## Guidelines:

- I have alredy created a simple yet effective agent in "D:\MY CODE\Projects\math\agent_math" but need to improve it to match defined functionalities in the assignment so i need to improve it with the help of you.
- use the GROQ_API_KEY for the agent framework
- use /knowledge\maths_kb2.json for knowledge base 
- use the SERPER_API_KEY for the search & retrieval Functionality pipeline 


# BUILD ON TOP/FROM "D:\MY CODE\Projects\math\agent_math" as the work is majority done but just need improvements. 
# use knowledge base existing ones knowledge from D:\MY CODE\Projects\math\agent_math\knowledge\
# use API keys from ".env"
# update & adapt UI & UX & routing in html, css, js, app.py, etc. (if possible update the ui to dark theme)
# plese don't overcomplicate my existing project instead improve it to reach the assignment's specifications that's all. 


"just, make it work... that's all.."
